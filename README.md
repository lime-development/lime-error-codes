This package provides short error codes and human-readable messages for [Lime smart contracts](https://github.com/lime-development/lime-contracts), supporting multilingual output (currently English).

## 🧩 About Lime Pad

[**Lime Pad**](https://lime.dev/) is a decentralized launchpad platform designed to help users create, launch, and manage smart contracts with safety and transparency. Lime Pad aims to make blockchain accessible to everyone — from developers to crypto communities.

The error codes in this package are tightly integrated with Lime Pad's smart contract suite, ensuring that frontends can deliver clear, understandable feedback to users.

## 🔧 Purpose

To minimize on-chain gas costs, our contracts use short error codes (e.g., `E1`, `E2`). This package maps those codes to full human-readable messages for frontend and UI applications.

npm install @lime-development/lime-errors-codes
