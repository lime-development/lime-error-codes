# 🍋 Lime Errors

This package provides short error codes and human-readable messages for [Lime smart contracts](https://github.com/lime-development/lime-contracts), supporting multilingual output (currently English).

## 🔧 Purpose

To minimize on-chain gas costs, our contracts use short error codes (e.g., `E1`, `E2`). This package maps those codes to full human-readable messages for frontend and UI applications.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install @lime-development/lime-errors
# or
yarn add @lime-development/lime-errors
