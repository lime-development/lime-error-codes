# Security Policy â€“ Lime

## Introduction

This document outlines the security practices and responsible disclosure policy for the `@lime-development/lime-errors-codes` package and other Lime projects. Our goal is to build transparent, secure, and community-driven products. We welcome contributions and responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.

---

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of our `lime-errors-codes` package:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.3.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.3   | :x:                |

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue. Instead, report it via:

ðŸ“§ **security@lime.dev**  

Please include:
- A detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggestions for mitigation

We will respond within **72 hours**, and work with you on a timeline for resolution and coordinated disclosure if necessary.

---

## Process

After submitting a vulnerability report, here's what you can expect:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll confirm receipt of your report within 72 hours
2. **Assessment**: Our security team will evaluate the vulnerability
3. **Resolution**: We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: Once fixed, we'll coordinate public disclosure with you

---

## Rewards

Lime may offer **bug bounties** for critical vulnerabilities depending on the severity, impact, and disclosure quality. While our error codes package itself may not qualify for significant bounties (as it mainly deals with error message translation), vulnerabilities in our smart contracts or core infrastructure may be eligible for rewards.

---

## Security Best Practices

For users of our packages:

1. Always use the latest version to ensure you have security updates
2. Pin your dependency versions in production environments
3. Run regular security audits on your dependencies
4. Keep error messages internal in production environments

---

## Disclaimer

We reserve the right to revise this policy at any time. By responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities, you agree not to exploit them for personal gain or share them with malicious actors.
